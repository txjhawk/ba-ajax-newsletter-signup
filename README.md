# ajax-newsletter-signup
Code to process newsletter signup via Ajax so page reload is not needed.

Theme is blueacorn/default. This allows the subscribe.phtml (subscribe form template file) to send the base url as a variable to the JS so that the controller file that checks/updates the database can be properly called.

Module is BlueAcorn_AjaxNewsletter.
